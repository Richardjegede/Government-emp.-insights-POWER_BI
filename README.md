Employement  insight Project using powerBI
I chose to work on this project by obtaining the raw dataset from Enterprise DNA and creating a compelling, interactive dashboard 
using Power BI.

Problem Statement
This Government employment data focuses on New Zealand comes from many different agencies and systems, making it hard to see a clear picture of the public sector workforce.
Information such as employee numbers, vacancies, roles, regions, and workforce trends is often reported in different ways and at different times. 
This makes it difficult for leaders and workforce planners to understand how government employment is changing over time.
The purpose of the Employment Insights dashboard is to help executives and HR teams easily track key workforce metrics within any selected time period, such as total headcount,open positions, turnover, and workforce distribution. 
However, working with this data is challenging because measures are not always consistent, reports are spread across multiple sources, and trends are not easy to visualise. 
For example,key employees indicator breakdown can be unclear.
Without a simple, centralised Power BI dashboard, it becomes harder to spot workforce risks, plan future staffing needs, and support informed decision-making. 
A unified dashboard is needed to bring employment data together, standardise key measures, and present clear, easy-to-understand insights for New Zealand’s public sector leaders.

Solution
This Power BI dashboard brings employment data into one clear and easy-to-use view. 
It uses simple visuals to show workforce trends, changes over time, and key employment metrics such as headcount, vacancies, and turnover.
The dashboard helps managers and leaders quickly understand workforce performance and make better, data-driven decisions. 
It supports workforce planning by highlighting staffing levels, open roles, and employment trends.
By turning complex employment data into clear insights,
the dashboard improves transparency and helps organisations manage and plan their workforce more effectively.

Steps I Took In This Project
1. Planned the project using basic knowledge of the AIMS grid.
2. Imported employment-related data from Excel into Power BI.
3. Cleaned and transformed the data in Power Query by fixing errors, removing duplicates, and standardising fields such as names, regions, and date formats.
4. Built relationships between tables, including active and inactive relationships where required.
5. Completed the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to prepare the data for analysis.
6. Created key employment measures and used them to build interactive visuals in Power BI.
7. Validated the data to confirm accuracy and reliability of the insights..

Major challenges and Customization made
No major challenges were encountered, as the data quality was generally good. 
Minor adjustments were made during data cleaning and measure creation to ensure consistency and accurate reporting across visuals

Insights
The dashboard provides a clear view about understanding the breakdown of the employee, along with the growth of employee hired over the course of the year.
It also shows the key employee indicator breakdown, sick day balance evaluation, also estimated the total salary cost  essentially the annual income generated from each customer which have increased by 5% in overall annual premium revenue.
Among our top five customers, HIKMA Group stands out as the largest, having insured a significant amount throughout the application process.
Looking at the top five industries, the INSURANCE sector remains the largest and highest-revenue industry in the country, consistently generating substantial revenue over the years.
These insights also reveal a shift in customer behavior: more people are engaging with our application process, likely due to the transparency and ease of access the dashboard provides on our online platform.

Future Consideration
I’m planning to develop an Insurance Application Insight App for both Android and iOS. This app will allow applicants to complete our forms conveniently from home or anywhere else. It will also offer additional features, such as letting customers view their own profiles. I won’t reveal too much just yet 😉—we can discuss the details when the time is right.

Key Learnings
Gained hands-on experience working with real business datasets.
Learned how to write and execute major analysis queries in Excel.
Learned how to connect database tables to Power BI.
Learned how to connect Excel files to Power BI and clean or modify unwanted data using Power Query.
Gained practical knowledge of key DAX functions and measures.
Learned how map visuals work and how to pinpoint exact locations for clear geographic insights.
Explored major analytical visuals and how to create comprehensive reports.
Completed all of this independently. Although it was challenging, I persevered and I think that deserves some recognition 😎🎂.
